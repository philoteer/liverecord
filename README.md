# Features
  * record.sh is an automatic recording and broadcasting script. Support youtube channel, twitcast channel, twitch channel, openrec channel, niconico live broadcast, niconico community, niconico channel (support logging into niconico account for recording), mirrativ channel, reality channel, 17live channel, chaturbate channel, bilibili channel, streamlink support live URL , M3u8 address supported by ffmpeg. bilibili recording supports no recording when the above channels have live broadcast, so as to simply exclude the retransmission recording; support the use of agents to record bilibili live broadcast. Support timing segmentation. Support rclone upload, onedrive upload (including 21Vianet version), Baidu cloud upload; support a specified number of upload error retry; support to choose whether to keep local files based on upload results.

  
  * install.sh is a one-click installation script. Currently only tested on ubuntu 18.04 and 19.10 systems, in theory, the newer Linux system should be available (centos system should replace apt with yum).


  * record_twitcast.py is optional and is a streamlined script that can record websocket. Because twitcast provides streams based on h5 and websocket, but the highest resolution of some live broadcasts can only be obtained through websocket, and ffmpeg does not support websocket, so we provide a script that can record websocket. Can also be used alone, the method is `python3 record_twitcast.py "ws or wss url" "Output file directory"`.  

  * download.sh has nothing to do with the recording function, it is a completely independent small script. The essence is to poll the first page of the live and video page of the youtube channel, generate a youtube video list, and back up the video recording, cover art, title and introduction of the video in the list. Support to try to download the live video immediately after downloading, because there is still a period of time after the live broadcast is complete before the file is deleted, and the download process is not affected by the file deletion once the download starts. Support to set the maximum live broadcast duration of download after triggering off-demand, because the live broadcast that is more than two hours need to wait for the suppression of downloaded video may not be complete. Support to create a new download after waiting for the completion of the compression in the case of downloading the uncompressed video, to ensure that the undeleted video is downloaded to the completion of the compression. Specific usage can be run directly without parameters`./download.sh`. (In addition, since the working status of the script depends entirely on the content of the video list, it may be strange to directly specify or modify the video list)

# installation method
### A key installation
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lovezzzxxx/liverecord/master/install.sh | bash`  
  * The one-click script will automatically install all the following environment dependencies, __and will also cover the installation of the go environment and add some environment variables .__ If necessary, you can comment out the corresponding commands or manually install the environment dependencies. Among them, record.sh and record_twitcast.py will be saved in the record folder of the directory where the command line is at runtime, and livedl will be saved in the livedl folder of the directory where the command line is at runtime.
  * __After one-click script installation, the script should be called `record/record.sh`instead of the example below`./record.sh`__  
  * After the one-click script finishes running, it will prompt operations that still need to be performed manually, such as updating environment variables and logging in to the network disk account

### Parameter Description

  * Required parameters, select recording method and corresponding channel number

website|The first parameter|The second parameter|Explanation|Precautions
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
youtube|`youtube`、`youtubeffmpeg`|`The ID section of the URL`(like UCWCc8tO-uUl_7SJXIKJACMw)|youtubeffmpeg for recording using ffmpeg|Please do not specify the third resolution parameter as best or 1080p60 and above
twitcast|`twitcast`、`twitcastffmpeg`、`twitcastpy`|`The ID section of the URL `(like kaguramea_vov)|twitcastffmpeg uses ffmpeg for recording, twitcastpy uses record_twitcast.py for recording|If the corresponding dependency is not installed, only the twitcast parameter can be used, and the highest resolution of twitcast cannot be recorded.__Please do not make multiple recordings of the same live broadcast, it will cause file naming problems__
niconico|`nicolv`、`nicoco`、`nicoch`|They are`niconico生放送号码`(eg. lv320447549)，`niconico社区号码`(eg. co41030)，`niconicochannel_number`(eg. macoto2525)|Can be added at the back`:ID,PW`to log in to the nico account for recording (such as nicolv: user@mail.com , password)|If the corresponding dependencies are not installed, niconico cannot be recorded.  __Please do not use the same account for multiple recordings of the same live broadcast, websocket link conflicts may occur, resulting in video freezes or repeated disconnections__
bilibili|`bilibili`、`bilibiliproxy`|`The ID part of the live broadcast URL`(eg. 12235923)|bilibiliproxy is to record through a proxy, you can directly add a`,Proxy ip:Proxy port`designated proxy server (such as bilibiliproxy, 127.0.0.1:1080), or you can add a proxy acquisition method in the corresponding part of the script
Other sites| `twitch`、`openrec`、`mirrativ`、`reality`、`17live`、`chaturbate`|`The ID section of the URL `，Where reality is the channel name (if it is a partial name, it matches one of the channels containing these texts) or vlive_id (the acquisition method can be found in the script)|Among them, twitch uses streamlink to detect the live broadcast status, the system occupies a high||
other|`streamlink`、`m3u8`|`Streamlink-supported personal homepage URL or live broadcast URL`、`M3u8 URL of live media stream`||

  * Optional parameters, you __need to fill in the middle parameters to specify subsequent parameters__

parameter|Features|Defaults|Other optional values|Explanation
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
The third parameter|Sharpness|`best`|`Sharpness 1,Sharpness 2`，Can be used to specify multiple definitions|Only the resolution contained in streamlink is supported and will be tried in sequence until the first available resolution is obtained
The fourth parameter|Whether to loop and record split time|`loop`|`once`or`Split seconds`|If it is specified as once, it will be terminated after the live broadcast is detected and a recording is made. If it is specified as a number, it will be recorded in loop mode and segmented when the recording is performed for the corresponding number of seconds.  __Note that there may be about ten seconds of video missing during segmentation__
The fifth parameter|Loop detection interval and minimum recording interval and the number of continuous detection starts required for recording start|`10,10,1`|`Loop detection interval seconds, the shortest recording interval seconds, the number of continuous detection starts required for recording start`, If it is not separated by, the shortest recording interval is also this value and the number of continuous detection starts required for recording start is 1|The loop detection interval means that if no live broadcast is detected, it will wait for the corresponding time for the next detection; the shortest recording interval means that after one recording ends, if the distance from the start of recording is less than the shortest recording interval, the shortest recording interval will be waited for the next detection . The shortest recording interval is mainly to prevent the situation that the live broadcast is detected but the recording is wrong. At this time, once a recording ends, if the next detection is performed immediately, it may be blocked because of too frequent detection or lead to high system occupation. This situation may appear on the website In special periods such as revisions, it should be noted that if a live broadcast time is too short or frequent interruption can also trigger waiting; the continuous detection of the number of start broadcasts required for recording start refers to the need to continuously detect the corresponding number of start broadcasts to start recording, which can be used for Prevent some situations where the live broadcast status is detected but not live broadcasted.
The sixth parameter|Local video storage directory|`record_video/other`|`Local directory`||
The seventh parameter|Whether to automatically backup|`nobackup`|`rclone:Network Disk Name:` + `onedrive` + `baidupan` + `number of retries` + `no/keep/del`，Directly connect together without spaces (such as rclone1del or rclone: vps: onedrivebaidupan3keep)|The first three items of rclone, onedrive, and baidupan refer to the network drives with the corresponding names uploaded by rclone, the onedrive network drives logged in by OneDriveUploader, and the Baidu cloud network drives logged in by BaiduPCS-Go. The fourth item is the number of retries. If not specified, the default is one try. The fifth item is whether to keep the local file after the upload is completed. If not specified, the local file will be deleted if the upload is successful, and the local file will be kept if the upload fails. The keep parameter is to keep the local file regardless of the result, and the del parameter is to delete the local file regardless of the result. If the recording is started when there is no live broadcast due to the occasional detection abnormality, and then a log file without a corresponding video file is generated, the script will automatically delete the log file without the corresponding video file
Eighth to fourteenth parameters|bilibili recording needs to be excluded from rebroadcast|`noexcept`|`corresponding channel_number`，The same as the second parameter, the order is youtube, twitcast, twitch, openrec, nicolv, nicoco, nicoch, mirrativ, reality, 17live, chaturbate, streamlink|Only bilibili recording is valid, and bilibili recording is not performed when it is detected that the corresponding channel is being broadcast live
